This is where you should save the toolboxes you want to use.
I've put files:
1) from my personnal tool box
2) compiled LIBSVM files for Win-64 bits and Linux-64 bits.
3) compiled EMD files for Win-64 bits and Linux-64 bits.

Depending on which method you want to use, you will need to install :
1) dd_toolbox
2) MILToolBox
3) prtools
4) vlfeat
